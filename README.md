# Meteor Lo-Dash

This is a smart package for use with [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) open-source web platform and the [Meteorite](http://oortcloud.github.io/meteorite/) package manager. It is meant to be downloadable from [Atmosphere](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/) package repository or from Github.

[Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/) is a utility library for JavaScript, similar to [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) but with better consistency, customization, performance, and extra features.


## How to install

1. `npm install -g meteorite` (if not already installed)
2. `mrt add lodash`

The package exports a global `lodash` variable, although it's meant to replace `_`, so run: `_ = lodash`.
